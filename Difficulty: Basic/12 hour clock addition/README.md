## Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find their sum in a **12-hour clock format** instead of a number line.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`num1 = 5`, `num2 = 7`  
**Output:**  
`0`  

**Explanation:**  
5 + 7 = 12 → On a 12-hour clock, 12 becomes **0**.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`num1 = 3`, `num2 = 5`  
**Output:**  
`8`  

**Explanation:**  
3 + 5 = 8 → This is already within the 12-hour range.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ 50
