# Sum of All Array Elements

## Problem Statement

You are given a vector (array) of integers of size `n` containing the elements.  
Your task is to **find the sum of all the integers** present in the array.  
As the sum can be large, return the value as a **long long** type.

---

## Input

- An integer `n` representing the size of the array.
- An array `arr` of `n` integers.

## Output

- Return the sum of all elements as a 64-bit integer (`long long`).

---

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁵

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**  
n = 7  
arr = [6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]  

**Output:**  
29  

**Explanation:**  
Sum of array elements = 6 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 29

## Expected Time Complexity

- **O(n)** – One pass through the array

## Expected Space Complexity

- **O(1)** – Constant space used
