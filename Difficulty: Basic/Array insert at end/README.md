## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` (not completely filled) and an integer `val`.  
Your task is to **insert the value at the end of the array**.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
`val = 90`  
**Output:**  
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90]`  
**Explanation:**  
After inserting 90 at the end, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90]`.

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 2, 3]`  
`val = 50`  
**Output:**  
`[1, 2, 3, 50]`  
**Explanation:**  
After inserting 50 at the end, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 50]`.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ element, arr[i] ≤ 10^6`
