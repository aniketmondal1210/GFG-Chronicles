# Check Automorphic Number

## Problem Statement

Given a number `N`, check whether the number is an **Automorphic number** or not.

A number is called **Automorphic** if its square ends with the number itself.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`N = 76`  
**Output:**  
`Automorphic`  

**Explanation:**  
76² = 5776, which ends with 76. So, 76 is an Automorphic number.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`N = 14`  
**Output:**  
`Not Automorphic`  

**Explanation:**  
14² = 196, which does not end with 14. So, it is not an Automorphic number.

## Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 1000`

---

## Expected Time Complexity

- `O(1)`

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- `O(1)`
