# C++ Data Types Problem

## Problem Statement
Read a value and store it in the appropriate **C++ Data Type**.  

You are required to complete the following functions:
- `cppIntType()` : reads an integer input, stores it in the appropriate data type, and returns it.  
- `cppCharType()` : reads a character input, stores it in the appropriate data type, and returns it.  
- `cppFloatType()` : reads a float input, stores it in the appropriate data type, and returns it.

## Example 1
**Input:**

2 h 2.555


**Output:**

2
h
2.555


**Explanation:**  
The three inputs are printed in order:  
- Integer → `2`  
- Character → `h`  
- Float → `2.555`

## Constraints
- Integer range: fits in `int`  
- Character range: fits in `char`  
- Float precision: fits in `float`
