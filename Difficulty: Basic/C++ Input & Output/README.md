# Multiply Two Integers

## Problem
Given two integers `A` and `B`, return their product.

---

## Constraints
- `0 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000`
- Expected Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

A = 1, B = 2

**Output**  

2

**Explanation**  
`1 × 2 = 2`

---

### Example 2
**Input**  

A = 8, B = 7

**Output**  

56

**Explanation**  
`8 × 7 = 56`

---

## Approach
- The multiplication of two integers is a **constant-time operation**.
- Simply return `a * b`.

✅ Time Complexity: `O(1)`  
✅ Space Complexity: `O(1)`
