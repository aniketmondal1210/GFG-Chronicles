# Compare Two Numbers

## Problem
Given two integers `A` and `B`, check whether:
- `A` is greater than `B`
- `A` is less than `B`
- `A` is equal to `B`

Print the result in the required format.

---

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10000`
- Expected Time Complexity: `O(1)`
- Expected Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

A = 2, B = 5

**Output**  

2 is less than 5


---

### Example 2
**Input**  

A = 6, B = 3

**Output**  

6 is greater than 3


---

### Example 3
**Input**  

A = 7, B = 7

**Output**  

7 is equals to 7


---

## Approach
- Use conditional statements to compare `A` and `B`.
- Print the result in the specified format.

✅ Time Complexity: `O(1)`  
✅ Space Complexity: `O(1)`
