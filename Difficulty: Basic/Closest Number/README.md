# Closest Number Divisible by m

## Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `m` (`m ≠ 0`), find the number **closest to `n`** that is **divisible by `m`**.  
If there is more than one such number, return the one having the **maximum absolute value**.

## Example 1
**Input:**  

n = 13
m = 4

**Output:**  

12

**Explanation:**  
12 is the closest number to 13 that is divisible by 4.

---

## Example 2
**Input:**  

n = -15
m = 6

**Output:**  

-18

**Explanation:**  
Both -12 and -18 are equally close to -15 and divisible by 6.  
Since -18 has the larger absolute value, it is chosen.

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or print anything.  
Your task is to complete the function **`closestNumber(n, m)`** which takes two integers and returns the closest number to `n` that is divisible by `m`.
