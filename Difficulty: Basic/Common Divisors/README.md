# Count of All Common Divisors

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `a` and `b`, the task is to find the **count of all common divisors** of the two numbers.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`a = 12`, `b = 24`  
**Output:**  
`6`  
**Explanation:**  
The common divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`a = 3`, `b = 17`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
The only common divisor is 1.

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= a, b <= 1000`

---

## Expected Time Complexity

- **O(âˆšn)**, where `n = gcd(a, b)`

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- **O(1)**
