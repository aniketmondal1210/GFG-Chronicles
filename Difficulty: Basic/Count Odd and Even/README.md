## Count Odd and Even Numbers in an Array

### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` of positive integers, return the count of the number of **odd** and **even** elements in the array.

### Input
- An array of positive integers `arr[]`.

### Output
- A list of two integers: `[odd_count, even_count]`

### Example 1
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [3, 2]
Explanation: There are 3 odd elements (1, 3, 5) and 2 even elements (2, 4).
```

### Example 2
```
Input: arr = [1, 1]
Output: [2, 0]
Explanation: There are 2 odd elements (1, 1) and no even elements.
```

### Constraints
- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^6
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
