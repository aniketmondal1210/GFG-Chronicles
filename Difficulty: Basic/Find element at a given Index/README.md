# Find Element at Given Index

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of integers and an index `key` (0-based index), return the element present at the index `key` in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
`key = 2`  
`arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`  
**Output:**  
`30`  
**Explanation:**  
The element at index 2 is 30.

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`key = 4`  
`arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]`  
**Output:**  
`50`  
**Explanation:**  
The element at index 4 is 50.

## Constraints

- `0 ≤ key ≤ arr.size - 1`
- `1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 10^6`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`

## Expected Time Complexity

- **O(1)** — Direct access by index

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- **O(1)** — No extra space used
