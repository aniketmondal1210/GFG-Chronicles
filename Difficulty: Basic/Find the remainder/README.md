# Find Remainder When Large Number is Divided by 7

## Problem Statement

Given a number `N` in the form of a **string**, determine the remainder when `N` is divided by 7.

**Note:**  
- The number is **very large**, so it's represented as a string to avoid overflow.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`N = "98"`  
**Output:**  
`0`  

**Explanation:**  
98 รท 7 = 14 with remainder 0.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`N = "13"`  
**Output:**  
`6`  

**Explanation:**  
13 รท 7 = 1 with remainder 6.

## Constraints

- `0 <= |N| <= 10^3`  
  (Where `|N|` is the number of digits in the string)

---

## Expected Time Complexity

- `O(|N|)`

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- `O(|N|)`
