# Find GCD of Two Numbers

## Problem
Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, find the **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** of `a` and `b`.  

⚠️ Do **not** use the inbuilt `gcd` function.

---

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

a = 20, b = 28

**Output**

4

**Explanation**  
Divisors of 20 → `{1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20}`  
Divisors of 28 → `{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28}`  
The largest common divisor is **4**.  

---

### Example 2
**Input**

a = 60, b = 36

**Output**

12

**Explanation**  
Divisors of 60 → `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60}`  
Divisors of 36 → `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}`  
The largest common divisor is **12**.
