# GCD of Two Numbers

## Problem Statement

Given two numbers `a` and `b`, the task is to find the **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** of `a` and `b`.

The **GCD** of two numbers is the **largest number** that can divide both `a` and `b` perfectly (without leaving a remainder).

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`a = 6`, `b = 9`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**  
After 3, there is no number that can divide both 6 and 9 perfectly.

---

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`a = 10`, `b = 15`

**Output:**  
`5`

**Explanation:**  
5 is the greatest number that divides both 10 and 15 without any remainder.

## Constraints:

- 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100
