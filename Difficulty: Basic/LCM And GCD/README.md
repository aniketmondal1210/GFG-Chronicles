# LCM and GCD of Two Numbers

## Problem Statement
Given two integers `a` and `b`, compute their **LCM** (Least Common Multiple) and **GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor), and return them in an array `[LCM, GCD]`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

a = 5, b = 10

**Output:**

[10, 5]

**Explanation:**  
- GCD(5, 10) = 5  
- LCM(5, 10) = (5 × 10) / 5 = 10  

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

a = 14, b = 8

**Output:**

[56, 2]

**Explanation:**  
- GCD(14, 8) = 2  
- LCM(14, 8) = (14 × 8) / 2 = 56  

---

### Example 3
**Input:**

a = 1, b = 1

**Output:**

[1, 1]

**Explanation:**  
- GCD(1, 1) = 1  
- LCM(1, 1) = (1 × 1) / 1 = 1  

---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^4
