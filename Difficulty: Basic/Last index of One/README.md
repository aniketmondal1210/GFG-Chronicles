# Find Last Index of '1' in a Binary String

## Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of `'0'`s and `'1'`s.  
The task is to find the **last index** (0-based) of `'1'` in the string.  

- If `'1'` is not present, return `-1`.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**

s = "00001"

**Output:**

4

**Explanation:**  
The last occurrence of `'1'` is at index `4`.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**

s = "0"

**Output:**

-1

**Explanation:**  
There is no `'1'` in the string.

---

## Constraints
- 1 <= |s| <= 10^6
- s = {0,1}

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
