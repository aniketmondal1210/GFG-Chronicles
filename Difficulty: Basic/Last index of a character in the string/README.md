# Find Last Index of a Character in a String

## Problem Statement
Given a string `S` and a character `X`, find the **last index** (0-based indexing) of `X` in `S`.  
If the character is not present, return `-1`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

S = "Geeks", X = 'e'

**Output:**

2

**Explanation:**  
The last occurrence of `'e'` is at index 2.

### Example 2
**Input:**

S = "okiyh", X = 'z'

**Output:**

-1

**Explanation:**  
Character `'z'` does not exist in the string.

---

## Constraints
- 1<= N <=(32-bit number)
- `S` and `X` contain only **uppercase** and **lowercase alphabets**.

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(|S|) 
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
