## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 4`  
**Output:**  
`true`  
**Explanation:**  
4 is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, so it is a leap year.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 2021`  
**Output:**  
`false`  
**Explanation:**  
2021 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.
