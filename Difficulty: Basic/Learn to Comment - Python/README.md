# Commenting in Python

## Problem Statement

Comments are very useful in any language to describe the purpose of any function or operation. Comments are **ignored by the compiler/interpreter**, so whatever you write in the comments won't affect the code execution.

In Python, comments can be written in the following ways:

```python
# This is a comment
""" This is also a comment """
