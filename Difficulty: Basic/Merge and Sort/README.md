# Merge Two Arrays with Unique Elements

## Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `arr1[]` and `arr2[]`.  
Your task is to **merge both arrays**, **remove duplicate elements**, and return the resulting array in **ascending order**.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  

arr1 = [11, 1, 8]
arr2 = [10, 11]


**Output:**  

[1, 8, 10, 11]


**Explanation:**  
After merging both arrays and removing duplicates, the sorted unique elements are `[1, 8, 10, 11]`.

### Example 2
**Input:**  

arr1 = [7, 1, 5, 3, 9]
arr2 = [8, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6]


**Output:**  

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]


**Explanation:**  
All unique elements from both arrays are merged and sorted in ascending order.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ arr1.size(), arr2.size() ≤ 10⁴
- 0 ≤ arr1[i], arr2[i] ≤ 10⁹
