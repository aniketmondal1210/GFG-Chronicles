# Product of All Elements in an Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of integers. Your task is to **calculate the product of all the elements** in the array.

---

## Examples

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
`n = 5`  
`arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`120`  
**Explanation:**  
`1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120`

---

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`n = 10`  
`arr = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`9765625`  
**Explanation:**  
`5^10 = 9765625`

---

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything.  
Complete the function `product()` which takes:
- `arr[]` (array of integers)
- `n` (number of elements)

and returns the **product of all elements**.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 5`

---

## Expected Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
