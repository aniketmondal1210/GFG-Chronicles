# Check if a Number is Sparse

## Problem Statement  
Given a number `n`, check whether it is a **sparse number** or not.  

ðŸ‘‰ A number is said to be **sparse** if **no two or more consecutive bits** are set (`1`) in its binary representation.  

---

## Examples  

### Example 1
**Input:**  

n = 2

**Output:**  

true

**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `2` is `10`.  
It has no consecutive set bits â†’ hence it is **sparse**.  

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  

n = 3

**Output:**  

false

**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `3` is `11`.  
It has **consecutive set bits** â†’ hence it is **not sparse**.  

---

## Constraints
- `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6`
