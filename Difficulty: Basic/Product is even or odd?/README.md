# Even or Odd Product of Two Large Numbers

## Problem Statement

You are given two long numbers `N1` and `N2` as strings. You need to determine if the product of these numbers is **even** or **odd**.  
If the product is even, return `1`; otherwise, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
`N1 = "12"`  
`N2 = "15"`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
`12 * 15 = 180`, which is an even number.

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`N1 = "123"`  
`N2 = "457"`  
**Output:**  
`0`  
**Explanation:**  
`123 * 457 = 56211`, which is an odd number.
