# Product of Factors of a Number

## Problem Statement
Given a number `N`, calculate the **product of all factors** of `N`.  
Since the result can be very large, compute the answer modulo **10^9 + 7**.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**

N = 6


**Output:**

36


**Explanation:**  
Factors of `6` are `[1, 2, 3, 6]`.  
Product = `1 * 2 * 3 * 6 = 36`.  
Answer = `36 % (10^9+7) = 36`.

## Example 2
**Input:**

N = 25


**Output:**

125


**Explanation:**  
Factors of `25` are `[1, 5, 25]`.  
Product = `1 * 5 * 25 = 125`.  
Answer = `125 % (10^9+7) = 125`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9`
