# Find Remainder of Two Numbers

## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n1` and `n2`, find the remainder when `n1` is divided by `n2`.

---

## Input

- `n1`: int – the dividend (0 ≤ n1 ≤ 10⁶)
- `n2`: int – the divisor (1 ≤ n2 ≤ 10⁶)

## Output

- int – the remainder when `n1` is divided by `n2`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
n1 = 5, n2 = 3  

**Output:**  
2  

**Explanation:**  
The remainder after dividing 5 by 3 is 2.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**  
n1 = 5, n2 = 10  

**Output:**  
5  

**Explanation:**  
Since 5 is less than 10, the remainder is 5.
