## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. You need to **convert all zeroes** of `n` to **fives** and return the new number.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
`n = 1004`

**Output:**  
`1554`

**Explanation:**  
There are two zeroes in `1004`. On replacing all zeroes with 5, the new number will be `1554`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**  
`n = 121`

**Output:**  
`121`

**Explanation:**  
Since there are no zeroes in `121`, the number remains unchanged.

## Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 10^4`
