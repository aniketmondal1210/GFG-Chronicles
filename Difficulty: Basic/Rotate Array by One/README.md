# Rotate Array by One Position

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr`, rotate the array by one position in a **clockwise direction**.

---

## Input

An array of integers `arr`.

**Constraints:**

```
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
```

---

## Output

Return or print the array after rotating it clockwise by one position.

---

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Output:**

```
[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation:** After rotating, `5` moves to the front and the rest shift one position right.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**

```
arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
```

**Output:**

```
[3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
```
**Explanation:** After one clockwise rotation, `3` moves to the first position.
