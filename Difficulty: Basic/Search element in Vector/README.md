# Binary Search in a Sorted Vector

## Problem Statement
You are given a vector `arr[]` containing non-negative integers sorted in **increasing order** and an integer `k`.  
Your task is to check whether the element `k` is present in the vector using **Binary Search**.

Return `true` if `k` is found, otherwise return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  

arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
k = 6

**Output:**  

true

**Explanation:**  
`6` is present at the 4th index.

### Example 2
**Input:**  

arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 6]
k = 5

**Output:**  

false

**Explanation:**  
`5` is not present in the array.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1000`  
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000`  
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 1000`
