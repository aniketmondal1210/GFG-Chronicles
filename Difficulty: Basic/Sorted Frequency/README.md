# Distinct Elements with Frequency (Sorted Order)

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr[]`, print:

- Each **distinct element**
- Along with its **frequency**
- In **increasing sorted order**
- Each on a **new line**

---

## Example

**Input**

arr = [3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4]


**Output**

1 1
2 2
3 2
4 1


**Explanation**

- 1 appears 1 time  
- 2 appears 2 times  
- 3 appears 2 times  
- 4 appears 1 time  

Sorted order → `1, 2, 3, 4`

---

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^4
