# Area Calculation using Structures

## Problem Statement
You are given a structure `area` with the following data members:
- `side` → side of a square  
- `len` → length of a rectangle  
- `wid` → width of a rectangle  

Your task is to:
1. Assign values to the data members.  
2. Calculate the **area of the square** using `side × side`.  
3. Calculate the **area of the rectangle** using `len × wid`.  

You will be given a function `find_area(side, len, wid)` which takes these values as arguments.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ side, len, wid ≤ 1000  

---

## Example

### Example 1
**Input**  

side = 25, len = 40, wid = 60


**Output**  

625 2400


**Explanation**  
- Area of square = `25 × 25 = 625`  
- Area of rectangle = `40 × 60 = 2400`
