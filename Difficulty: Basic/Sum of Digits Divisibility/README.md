# Divisibility by Sum of Digits

## Problem
Given a number **N**, check whether it is divisible by the sum of its digits or not.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

N = 18

**Process:**

Sum of digits = 1 + 8 = 9
18 % 9 = 0 → divisible

**Output:**

1


---

### Example 2
**Input:**

N = 25

**Process:**

Sum of digits = 2 + 5 = 7
25 % 7 = 4 → not divisible

**Output:**

0


---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9  

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log N)  
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
