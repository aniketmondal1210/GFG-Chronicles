# Sum of Proper Divisors

## Problem Statement
Given a natural number `n`, calculate the **sum of all its proper divisors**.  

- A **proper divisor** of a number is a divisor that is strictly less than the number itself.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

n = 10

**Output:**

8

**Explanation:**  
Proper divisors of 10 are {1, 2, 5}.  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 5 = **8**

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

n = 6

**Output:**

6

**Explanation:**  
Proper divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3}.  
Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 = **6**

---

## Constraints
- 2 <= n <= 10^6

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(n)) 
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
