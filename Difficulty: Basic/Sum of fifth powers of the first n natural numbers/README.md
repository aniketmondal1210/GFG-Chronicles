# Sum of Fifth Powers of Natural Numbers

## Problem Statement
You are given a number `N`. Your task is to calculate the **sum of the fifth powers** of natural numbers till `N`.

That is:
1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 + ...... + N^5

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

N = 2


**Output:**

33


**Explanation:**  

1^5 + 2^5 = 1 + 32 = 33

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

N = 3


**Output:**

276


**Explanation:**  

1^5 + 2^5 + 3^5 = 1 + 32 + 243 = 276

---

## Constraints
- 1 <= N <= 1000

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

> Since the sum of powers can be computed directly using a mathematical formula, we aim for `O(1)` solution instead of looping up to `N`.
