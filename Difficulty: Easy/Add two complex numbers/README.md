# Add Two Complex Numbers using Struct in C++

## Problem Statement
You are given a `struct Complex` that contains two data members:
- `int real`
- `int imag`

Your task is to complete the function `add()` which takes two complex numbers as input and **returns their sum** as a new complex number.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**  

c1 = 3 + 6i
c2 = -1 + 4i


**Output:**  

2 + 10i


**Explanation:**  
- Real part = 3 + (-1) = 2  
- Imaginary part = 6 + 4 = 10  
So the result is `2 + 10i`.

## Constraints
- `-1000 ≤ real, imag ≤ 1000`
