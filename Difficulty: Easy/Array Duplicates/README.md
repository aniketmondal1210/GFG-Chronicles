# Find All Duplicates in an Array

## Problem
You are given an array `arr[]` of size `n`, containing elements from the range `1` to `n`, where **each element appears at most twice**.  
Your task is to return an array of all integers that appear twice.

> Note: The output can be in any order, but it will be printed in sorted order by the driver code.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n`

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

arr = [2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
