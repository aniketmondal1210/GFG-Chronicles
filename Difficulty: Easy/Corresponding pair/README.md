# Pair Elements from Two Arrays

## Problem Statement
You are given two arrays `a[]` and `b[]` of size `n`.  
The task is to make pairs containing values corresponding from `a[]` and `b[]`, i.e. `(a[0], b[0]), (a[1], b[1]) ...` and store them in the result array `res[]`.

---

## Examples

**Input:**  

n = 5
a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b[] = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


**Output:**  

res[] = [(1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 10)]

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= a[i], b[j] <= 100
