# Count Elements Smaller Than X

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array `arr[]` of size `N` containing non-negative integers, and an integer `X`, the task is to count the number of elements in the array which are **strictly smaller** than `X`.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
N = 5  
arr = [4, 5, 3, 1, 2]  
X = 3  
**Output:**  
2  
**Explanation:**  
Elements smaller than 3 are [1, 2].

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
N = 6  
arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]  
X = 3  
**Output:**  
6  
**Explanation:**  
All elements are smaller than 3.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁶  
- 1 ≤ arr[i], X ≤ 10⁵

## Expected Time Complexity

- **O(N)**

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- **O(1)**
