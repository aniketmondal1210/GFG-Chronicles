# Count Zeros in a Sorted Binary Array

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` consisting only of `0`s and `1`s. The array is **sorted** such that all the `1`s appear first, followed by all the `0`s.

Your task is to find the **count of all the `0`s** in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
There are 3 zeros at the end of the array.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`5`  
**Explanation:**  
All elements are 0s.

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- Each element of `arr` is either `0` or `1`
- The array is sorted such that all `1`s come before all `0`s.
