# Declare Variables of Different Data Types

## Problem Statement
You have to declare **4 variables** `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` of the following data types respectively inside the `main` function:  
- `int`  
- `float`  
- `double`  
- `long long`  

**Note:**  
- These variables are checked with their types in the main function.  
- You don't need to change or use them.  
- You will get a **Verified** verdict if you declare these variables correctly.
