# Check if Binary Number is Divisible by 5

## Problem Statement

Given a binary number in the form of a string, check whether its **decimal representation is divisible by 5** or not.

---

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`bin = "1010"`  
**Output:**  
`Yes`  
**Explanation:**  
The decimal equivalent of `"1010"` is `10`, which is divisible by 5.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`bin = "1110"`  
**Output:**  
`No`  
**Explanation:**  
The decimal equivalent of `"1110"` is `14`, which is **not** divisible by 5.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10⁵`
- The input string `bin` consists of only characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

---

## Expected Time Complexity

- `O(|S|)`

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- `O(1)`
