# Filter Elements Less Than k from Vector

## Problem
You are given a vector `arr[]` and an integer `k`.  
You need to return the list (vector) of elements **less than `k`**.  
The order of elements should remain the same as in the original array.  

If there is no element less than `k`, return an empty vector.

### Example 1
**Input:**

arr[] = [5, 3, 6, 1, 3], k = 4

**Output:**

3 1 3

**Explanation:** Elements less than 4 are `{3, 1, 3}`.

### Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`
