# Problem: Power of a Number (Modulo 10⁹ + 7)

## Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, find `a^b` (a raised to the power b).  
Output your answer **modulus (10⁹ + 7)**.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**  

a = 1, b = 1

**Output:**  

1

**Explanation:**  
1¹ % (10⁹ + 7) = 1

---

## Example 2
**Input:**  

a = 2, b = 5

**Output:**  

32

**Explanation:**  
2⁵ % (10⁹ + 7) = 32

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or print anything.  
Your task is to complete the function **`power(a, b)`** which takes two integers `a` and `b` as inputs and returns the result.

## Expected Time Complexity

O(log b)


## Expected Auxiliary Space

O(1)


---

## Constraints

1 ≤ a ≤ 10⁵
1 ≤ b ≤ 10¹⁶
