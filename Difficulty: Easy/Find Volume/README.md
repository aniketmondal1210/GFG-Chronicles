# Find Volume of Cube and Rectangular Box

## Problem Statement
You are given dimensions of geometric objects.  
- For a **cube**, only its side `s` is given.  
- For a **rectangular box**, its length `l`, width `w`, and height `h` are given.  

You need to calculate the **exact volume** of these objects.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  

s = 2

**Output:**  

8

**Explanation:**  
Volume of cube = `s³ = 2³ = 8`.

### Example 2
**Input:**  

l = 1, w = 2, h = 3

**Output:**  

6

**Explanation:**  
Volume of rectangular box = `l × w × h = 1 × 2 × 3 = 6`.
