# Find Index of Element in Tuple

## Problem Statement

Given a tuple `arr` with distinct elements and an integer `x`, find the index position of `x`.  
Assume that `x` is always present in the tuple.  
Print the index (0-based).

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`arr = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, `x = 3`  
**Output:**  
`2`

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`arr = (3, 2, 1, 5, 4)`, `x = 5`  
**Output:**  
`3`

## Constraints

- All elements in `arr` are distinct  
- `x` is guaranteed to be in `arr`
