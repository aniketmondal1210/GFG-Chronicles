# Find the Smallest and Second Smallest Elements in an Array

## Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` of integers, return the **smallest** and **second smallest** elements in the array.  
If the second smallest element does not exist (i.e., all elements are equal), return `[-1]`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

arr[] = [2, 4, 3, 5, 6]

**Output:**

[2, 3]

**Explanation:**  
The smallest element is `2` and the second smallest is `3`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

arr[] = [1, 1, 1]

**Output:**

[-1]

**Explanation:**  
All elements are the same; there is no distinct second smallest element.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`  
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`
