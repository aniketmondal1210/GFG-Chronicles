# Least Common Multiple (LCM)

## Problem Statement
You are given two positive integers `a` and `b`.  
Your task is to compute and return the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of the two numbers.

- The **LCM** of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

## Example 1
**Input:**  

a = 12, b = 18


**Output:**  

36


**Explanation:**  
- Multiples of `12`: 12, 24, **36**, 48, 60 ...  
- Multiples of `18`: 18, **36**, 54, 72 ...  
- The smallest common multiple is `36`.

## Example 2
**Input:**  

a = 5, b = 11


**Output:**  

55


**Explanation:**  
- Multiples of `5`: 5, 10, 15, 20, ... , **55**  
- Multiples of `11`: 11, 22, 33, 44, **55**  
- The smallest common multiple is `55`.
