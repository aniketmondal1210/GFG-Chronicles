## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**

arr = [12, 34, 10, 6, 40]

**Output:**

74

**Explanation:**  
The two largest numbers are `40` and `34`.  
Their sum is `40 + 34 = 74`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**

arr = [10, 20, 30]

**Output:**

50

**Explanation:**  
The two largest numbers are `30` and `20`.  
Their sum is `50`.

## Constraints
- 2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6 
- 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
- All elements are **distinct**

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
