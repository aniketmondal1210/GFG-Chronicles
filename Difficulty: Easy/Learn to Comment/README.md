# Comment a Line of Code

## Problem Statement
You are given a code that prints three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.  
You need to **comment on the line of code that prints the integer `b`** such that this line does not compile.

> Note:  
> - `/* This is a comment */`  
> - `// This is also a comment`

## Example 1

**Input:**  

a = 5, b = 6, c = 15


**Output:**  

5 15


**Explanation:**
