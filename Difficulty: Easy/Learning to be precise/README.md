# Floating Point Precision in C++

## Problem Statement
There are times when your answer is a floating point number that contains more digits than required.  
You are given two floating numbers **a** and **b**. You need to output:
1. The exact value of `a/b`.
2. The value of `a/b` rounded to **3 decimal places**.

## Example
### Input

a = 5.43
b = 2.653


### Output

2.04674 2.047


### Explanation
- The division result is `2.04674...`
- Printing with precision up to **3 decimal places** gives `2.047`.
