# Swap Two Numbers using Pointers

## Problem
This module is all about **pointers** and how they can be cleverly employed to solve typical C problems.  

You are given two integers `A` and `B`. The task is to **swap** the two numbers.  
Swapping here means to interchange the values of `A` and `B`.

---

## Example 1
**Input:**

A = 3
B = 5


**Output:**

5 3


**Explanation:**  
Initially, `A = 3` and `B = 5`.  
After swapping:  
- `A = 5`  
- `B = 3`

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= A, B <= 10^6`
