# Merge Two Sorted Arrays In-Place Using Min-Heap

## Problem
You are given two **sorted arrays** `a[]` and `b[]`.  
Modify both arrays such that after merging their elements, the resultant array formed by combining `a[]` and `b[]` is sorted.

The merging should be done in **constant space**.  
Use a **min-heap** to facilitate the required operations.  

The driver code will print `a[]` followed by `b[]`.

### Example

**Input:**

a[] = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]
b[] = [2, 3, 8, 13]


**Output:**

1 2 3 5 8 9 10 13 15 20

### Constraints
- `1 ≤ a.size(), b.size() ≤ 10^5`
