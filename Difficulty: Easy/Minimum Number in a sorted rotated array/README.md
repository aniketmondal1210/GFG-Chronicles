## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

N = 10
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]

**Output:**

1

**Explanation:**  
The array is rotated once anti-clockwise. The minimum element is `1`.

### Example 2
**Input:**

N = 5
arr = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

**Output:**

1

**Explanation:**  
The array is rotated. The minimum element is `1`.
