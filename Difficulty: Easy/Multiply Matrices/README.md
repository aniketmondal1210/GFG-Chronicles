# Matrix Multiplication

## Problem
You are given two square matrices `A[][]` and `B[][]`.  
Your task is to complete the function `multiply()` which stores the multiplied result into a new matrix `C[][]`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

N = 2
A[][] = {{7, 18},
{2, 9}}
B[][] = {{14, 5},
{5, 18}}


**Output:**

188 359 73 172


**Explanation:**  
Matrix multiplication results in:  

res[][] = {{188, 359},
{73, 172}}


---

### Example 2
**Input:**

N = 1
A[][] = {2}
B[][] = {3}


**Output:**

6


**Explanation:**  
Both matrices are of size `1 x 1`, so result is:  

res = {6}


---

## Your Task
You don’t need to read input or print anything.  
Complete the function **`multiply()`** that takes `A`, `B`, `C`, and `N` as input parameters and fills `C` with the result of matrix multiplication.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 20
