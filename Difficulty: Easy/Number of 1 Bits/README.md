# Count of Set Bits

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, your task is to **return the count of set bits** (i.e., the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `n`).

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`n = 6`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `6` is `'110'`. It has `2` set bits.

---

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
`n = 8`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `8` is `'1000'`. It has `1` set bit.

---

### Example 3  
**Input:**  
`n = 3`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
Binary representation of `3` is `'11'`. It has `2` set bits.
