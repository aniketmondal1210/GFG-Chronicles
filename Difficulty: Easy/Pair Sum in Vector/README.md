# Sum of Second Elements in Vector of Pairs

## Problem Statement
You are given a vector `V` of size `n`. The vector holds pairs of integers in the form:  

V = {(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)}

Your task is to **find the sum of all second elements** from the pairs.

## Example

### Example 1
**Input:**  

N = 5
V = {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)}


**Output:**  

30


**Explanation:**  
Second elements are `2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7`  
- `0 ≤ Vi ≤ 10^7`  

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
- **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`
