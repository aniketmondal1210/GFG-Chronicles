# String Partition Problem Solution

## Problem Statement

Given a string number `S` and two integers `a` and `b`, divide the string into two non-empty parts such that:
1. The first part is divisible by `a`.
2. The second part is divisible by `b`.

If multiple answers exist, return the string such that the **first non-empty part has the minimum length**. If no such partition is possible, return `"-1"`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 10^6`
- `1 <= a, b <= N`
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`
