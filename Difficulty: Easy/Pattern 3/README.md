# Print Number Triangle Pattern

## Problem Statement

Geek is very fond of patterns. His teacher gave him an integer `n` and asked him to build the following triangle pattern:

For a given number `n`, print the triangle such that:

- First row contains `1`
- Second row contains `1 2`
- Third row contains `1 2 3`
- And so on, until the nth row contains `1 2 3 ... n`

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`n = 5`  
**Output:**
```bash
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`n = 3`  
**Output:**
```bash
1
1 2
1 2 3
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 100`
