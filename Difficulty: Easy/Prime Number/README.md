# Check Prime Number

## Problem
Given an integer `n`, determine whether it is a **prime number**.  
A **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

n = 7

**Output:**

true

**Explanation:**  
7 has exactly two divisors: 1 and 7.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

n = 25

**Output:**

false

**Explanation:**  
25 has divisors: 1, 5, 25 → more than two divisors.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**

n = 1

**Output:**

false

**Explanation:**  
1 has only one divisor (1), so it is **not prime**.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9
