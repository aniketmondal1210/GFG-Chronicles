# Print "GFG" N Times Without Loop (Using Recursion)

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer **N**.  
Your task is to print `"GFG"` exactly **N times** without using any loop, only recursion.

## Example

### Input

5

### Output

GFG GFG GFG GFG GFG


---

## Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 1000`

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`  
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(N)` (due to recursion stack)
