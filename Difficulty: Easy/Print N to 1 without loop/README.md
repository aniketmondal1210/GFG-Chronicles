# Print Numbers from N to 1 Recursively

## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `N`.  
You need to print numbers from `N` down to `1` (space separated), **without using loops**, only recursion.

---

## Example 1
**Input**:  

N = 10


**Output**:  

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


---

## Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 1000`  
- **Expected Time Complexity**: `O(N)`  
- **Expected Auxiliary Space**: `O(N)` (due to recursion)
