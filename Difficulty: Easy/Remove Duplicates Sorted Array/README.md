# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem
You are given a **sorted array** `arr[]` containing positive integers.  
Your task is to **remove all duplicate elements** so that each element appears only once.  
Return an array containing these distinct elements in the **same order** as they appeared.

---

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6`

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**

arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

**Output**

[2]

**Explanation:**  
All elements are `2`, so only one instance remains.

---

### Example 2
**Input**

arr = [1, 2, 4]

**Output**

[1, 2, 4]

**Explanation:**  
Array already contains unique elements.
