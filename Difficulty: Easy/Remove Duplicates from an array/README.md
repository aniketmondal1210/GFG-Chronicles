# Remove Duplicate Elements from an Array

## Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr[]` consisting of **positive integers**.

Your task is to **remove all duplicate numbers** from the array and return the resulting array.  
The **relative order of the first occurrences** of elements should be preserved.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 5]


**Output:**

[2, 3, 7, 5]


**Explanation:**  
Duplicates of `2` and `3` are removed while keeping their first occurrences.

### Example 2
**Input:**

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


**Output:**

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


**Explanation:**  
There are no duplicate elements, so the array remains unchanged.

## Constraints

- 2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
- 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
