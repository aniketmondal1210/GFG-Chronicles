## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr[]`.  
Your task is to **reverse** the given array.

📝 **Note:** Modify the array in place.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]`  
**Explanation:**  
The array elements are reversed in-place. First becomes last, second becomes second-last, and so on.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [4, 5, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`[2, 5, 4]`

### Example 3:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1]`  
**Output:**  
`[1]`  
**Explanation:**  
Array has a single element, so reversing it does not change the array.

## Constraints

- `1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`
