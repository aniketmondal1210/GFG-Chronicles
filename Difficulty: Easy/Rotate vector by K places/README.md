# Left Rotate a Vector by K Places

## Problem Statement
You are given a vector `arr[]` and an integer `k`. You need to **left rotate the vector by k places**.

---

## Examples

**Input:**  


arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 3


**Explanation:** The array after 2 left rotations becomes `[2, 1, 0, 4, 3]`.

## Constraints
- `1 <= arr.size() <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 1000`
