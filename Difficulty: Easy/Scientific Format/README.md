# Scientific Notation Formatting in C++

## Problem Statement
Sometimes, the output of a calculation is in `double` data type, and we need to represent it in **scientific notation**.  
Your task is to take an input `a` (a double value) and print it in **scientific format** with **precision up to 4 decimal places**.

## Example
