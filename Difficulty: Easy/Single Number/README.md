# Find the Number with Odd Occurrences

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr[]` of positive integers where **every element appears an even number of times except for one**.  
Your task is to find that one number which occurs an **odd number of times**.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
All elements appear twice except for `2`, which appears thrice.

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`arr = [8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
All elements appear twice except `1`, which appears once.

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^6`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`
- Exactly one element occurs an odd number of times

---

## Expected Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`
