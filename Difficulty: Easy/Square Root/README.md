# Floor of Square Root

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, find the **square root** of `n`.  
If `n` is not a perfect square, return the **floor value** of the square root.

The floor value of a number is the greatest integer less than or equal to that number.

## Examples

### Example 1:
Input:  
`n = 4`  
Output:  
`2`  
Explanation: 4 is a perfect square, so the square root is 2.

### Example 2:
Input:  
`n = 11`  
Output:  
`3`  
Explanation: 11 is not a perfect square.  
The square root of 11 is approximately 3.3166, so the floor is 3.

### Example 3:
Input:  
`n = 1`  
Output:  
`1`

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^4`
