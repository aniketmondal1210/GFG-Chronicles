# Sort Students by Marks

## Problem
You are given a vector containing names of `N` students (in lowercase letters) and their marks in an exam.  
The task is to sort the students:
- Students with **higher marks first**  
- If marks are the same → sort by **lexicographic order of names**

### Example 1

**Input:**

N = 4
michal 56
john 100
abbas 98
jordan 45


**Output:**

john 100
abbas 98
michal 56
jordan 45


**Explanation:**  
Marks sorted in decreasing order → [100, 98, 56, 45]  
So output follows this order.
