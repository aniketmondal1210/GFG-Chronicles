# Sum of Unique Frequency Elements

## Problem
You are given an integer array `arr[]`.  
Your task is to **find the sum of all elements whose frequency is exactly 1**.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  

arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 4]

**Output:**  

4

**Explanation:**  
- Frequency of `1` → 2  
- Frequency of `2` → 2  
- Frequency of `4` → 1  

Only `4` occurs once → **sum = 4**

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  

arr = [5, 6, 5, 7, 8, 8]

**Output:**  

13

**Explanation:**  
- Frequency of `5` → 2  
- Frequency of `6` → 1  
- Frequency of `7` → 1  
- Frequency of `8` → 2  

Unique elements = `6 + 7 = 13`

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4`  
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`
