# Sum of Prime Numbers up to N

## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, compute and return the **sum of all prime numbers** between `1` and `n` (inclusive).

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than `1` that has no positive divisors other than `1` and itself.

---

## Input
- A single integer `n`

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5


---

## Output
- A single integer representing the sum of all prime numbers up to `n`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

5

**Output:**

10

**Explanation:**  
Prime numbers ≤ 5 → 2, 3, 5  
Sum = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

10

**Output:**

17

**Explanation:**  
Prime numbers ≤ 10 → 2, 3, 5, 7  
Sum = 17
