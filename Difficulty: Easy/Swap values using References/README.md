# Swap Two Numbers using Pass by Reference

## Problem
Given two integers `a` and `b`. The task is to **swap two numbers using pass by reference**.  
Swapping means to interchange the values of `a` and `b`.

---

## Input Format
- Two integers `a` and `b`.

---

## Output Format
- Print the values of `a` and `b` after swapping, separated by a space.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

a = 3, b = 5


**Output**  

5 3


**Explanation**  
Here, `a = 3` and `b = 5`. After swapping, `a = 5` and `b = 3`.
