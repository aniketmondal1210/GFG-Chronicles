# Read and Print Integer and String

## Problem Statement

Before implementing any algorithm, we should be thorough with taking inputs.  
Here, we will learn how to **read inputs**.

You are given two inputs:
- `a` (an integer)
- `b` (a string)

You need to **take the input** and **print `a` and `b` separated by a space**, followed by a newline.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`a = 5`  
`b = Hello`  
**Output:**  
`5 Hello`  

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`a = 7`  
`b = Geeks`  
**Output:**  
`7 Geeks`
