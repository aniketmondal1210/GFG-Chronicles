# Find Minimum in U-Shaped Array

## Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr[]` that **strictly decreases** and then **strictly increases**.  
Such an array is said to be **U-shaped (unimodal)**.  

Your task is to find the **index of the minimum element** present in the array.

## Example 1
**Input:**  

arr = [9, 7, 5, 2, 3, 6, 10]


**Output:**  

3


**Explanation:**  
The minimum element is `2`, which is at index `3`.

## Example 2
**Input:**  

arr = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 12, 14]


**Output:**  

4


**Explanation:**  
The minimum element is `2`, which is at index `4`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5`  
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6`  
- Array is guaranteed to be U-shaped.
