## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 2, 1, 5, 5]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
Since `2` occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, `2` is the answer.

### Example 2

**Input:**  
`arr = [2, 30, 2, 15, 20, 30, 15]`  
**Output:**  
`20`  
**Explanation:**  
Since `20` occurs once, while other numbers occur twice, `20` is the answer.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6`  
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`
