# Print Multiplication Table in Reverse using While Loop

## Problem
`while` loop is another loop like `for` loop but unlike `for` loop it only checks for one condition.  

Here, we will use a `while` loop and print a number `n`'s table in reverse order.

---

## Input Format
- An integer `n`.

---

## Output Format
- Print the multiplication table of `n` from `n*10` down to `n*1`.  
- The numbers should be separated by spaces.  
- Print a newline at the end.

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

n = 1


**Output**  

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


---

### Example 2
**Input**  

n = 2


**Output**  

20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2

## Your Task
You don't need to read input or return anything.  
Complete the function **`printTable()`** which takes `n` as the input parameter and prints the table in reverse order with spaces and a newline character at the end.

---

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  

---

## Expected Time Complexity
- **O(n)**  

## Expected Space Complexity
- **O(1)**
