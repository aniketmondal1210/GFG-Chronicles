# Print Numbers from n to 0

## Problem Statement

You are given a number `n`. The number `n` can be negative or positive.

- If `n` is negative, print numbers from `n` to `0` by adding `1` to `n` in the `neg()` function.
- If `n` is positive, print numbers from `n-1` to `0` by subtracting `1` from `n` in the `pos()` function.

**Note:** You don't have to return anything, just print the numbers as space-separated values.
