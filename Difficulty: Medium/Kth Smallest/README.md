# Kth Smallest Element in an Array

## Problem
Given an array `arr[]` and an integer `k` (where `k` is smaller than or equal to the size of the array),  
your task is to find the **kth smallest element** in the given array.

---

## Follow-up
- Do not solve this using the inbuilt `sort()` function.

---

## Input
- An array `arr[]` of integers.  
- An integer `k`.  

---

## Output
- The kth smallest element in the array.  

---

## Constraints
- `1 <= arr.size <= 10^6`  
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`  
- `1 <= k <= n`  

---

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input**  

arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
k = 3

**Output**  

7

**Explanation**  
The 3rd smallest element is `7`.  

---

### Example 2
**Input**  

arr = [2, 3, 1, 20, 15]
k = 4

**Output**  

15

**Explanation**
