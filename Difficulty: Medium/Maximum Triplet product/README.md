# Maximum Triplet Product

## Problem
Given an array `arr` of size `n`, find the **maximum triplet product** in the array.

A triplet product is the product of any three numbers from the array.  
You need to find the largest possible such product.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

n = 4
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]

**Output:**

30

**Explanation:**

The maximum triplet product is 5 * 3 * 2 = 30.


---

### Example 2
**Input:**

n = 7
arr = [-3, -5, 1, 0, 8, 3, -2]

**Output:**

120

**Explanation:**

The maximum triplet product is (-3) * (-5) * 8 = 120.

## Constraints
- 3 ≤ n ≤ 5×10⁵  
- -10⁶ ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10⁶

---

## Expected Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
