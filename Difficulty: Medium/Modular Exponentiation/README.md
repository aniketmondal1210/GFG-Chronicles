# Problem: Modular Exponentiation

## Problem Statement
Given three integers `x`, `n`, and `M`, compute the value of:

(x^n) mod M

That is, find the remainder when `x` raised to the power `n` is divided by `M`.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

x = 3, n = 2, M = 4


**Output:**

1


**Explanation:**
3^2 = 9 mod 4 = 1

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

x = 2, n = 6, M = 10


**Output:**

4


**Explanation:**
2^6 =  64 mod 10 = 4
