## Problem Statement
Given a number `n`, find the value of `n` raised to the power of its own **reverse**.  
The result will always fit into a 32-bit signed integer.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**

n = 2

**Output:**

4

**Explanation:**  
The reverse of `2` is `2`, and `2² = 4`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**

n = 10

**Output:**

10

**Explanation:**  
The reverse of `10` is `1` (leading zero is discarded), and `10¹ = 10`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`
