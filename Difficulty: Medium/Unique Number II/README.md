# Find the Two Non-Repeating Elements

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` containing `2*n + 2` positive numbers, out of which `2*n` numbers exist in pairs, whereas only two numbers occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers.  
Return the answer in **increasing order**.
