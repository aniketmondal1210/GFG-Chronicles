# Swap Two Numbers

## Problem
Given two numbers `a` and `b`, swap their values so that `a` holds the value of `b` and `b` holds the value of `a`.

## Examples
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Initially a = 1 and b = 2, now a = 2 and b = 1.

Input: a = 6, b = 7
Output: 7 6
Explanation: Initially a = 6 and b = 7, now a = 7 and b = 6.
```
